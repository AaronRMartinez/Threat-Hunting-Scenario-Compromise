# Threat Event (System Compromise)
**Threat Actor Malicious File Download and Malicious File Execution**

### `MaliciousExecutable.exe` Creation

The "malicious" executable used within the project was originally written as a PowerShell script and converted into an exectuable using `PS2EXE`.

## Steps the "Bad Actor" took Create Logs and IoCs:
1. Download the TOR browser installer: https://www.torproject.org/download/
2. Install it silently: ```tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.1.exe /S```
3. Opens the TOR browser from the folder on the desktop
4. Connect to TOR and browse a few sites. For example:
   - **WARNING: The links to onion sites change a lot and these have changed. However if you connect to Tor and browse around normal sites a bit, the necessary logs should still be created:**
   - Current Dread Forum: ```dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion```
   - Dark Markets Forum: ```dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/d/DarkNetMarkets```
   - Current Elysium Market: ```elysiumutkwscnmdohj23gkcyp3ebrf4iio3sngc5tvcgyfp4nqqmwad.top/login```

6. Create a folder on your desktop called ```tor-shopping-list.txt``` and put a few fake (illicit) items in there
7. Delete the file.
